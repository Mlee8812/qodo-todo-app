### How This Was Built (Qodo Gen Agent)

This app was scaffolded and iterated using the Qodo Gen VS Code extension:
	
 1)	Installed the Qodo Gen extension and signed in.
 2)	Prompted the agent to generate React + TS components, a useTodos hook, and tests.
 3)	Used follow-up prompts to add accessibility and fix edge cases.
 4)	Captured screenshots and documented issues during testing.
